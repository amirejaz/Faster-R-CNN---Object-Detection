# Faster R-CNN Object Detection
This project demonstrates the use of Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone for object detection. The implementation leverages PyTorch and Torchvision libraries to load a pre-trained model and perform inference on input images.

### Features
- Uses Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 backbone pre-trained on COCO dataset.
- Supports object detection on images.
- Provides visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes.
